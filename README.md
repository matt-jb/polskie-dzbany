# Polskie Dzbany

Node.js app about stereotypical polish drivers.

## What is it?

An app that gathers data that users can submit about the number of vehicle accidents on the "Polskie Drogi" and "Stop Cham" YouTube channels.

## Why?

The vehicle number in Poland is public (or at least was, as of late 2019). That means, we can draw a nice anecdotal evidence about what cars do risky drivers really buy.

## How does it do that?

The app counts gets the number of cars that's in the database, draws percentages and compares them with the percentages of accidents caused by drivers of various brands. The difference in these percentages is the key number you're looking for in this project. Of course, the dataset needs to be large enough, so the more episodes of "Stop Cham" and "Polskie Drogi" I've got in the database, the more accurate this anecdotal evidence is.
